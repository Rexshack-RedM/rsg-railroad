## Dependencies

- [rsg-core](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-core)
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target)
- [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)

## Installation

1. **Items** — Add items from `install/shared_items.lua` to your `rsg-core/shared/items.lua`
2. **Item Images** — Add `coal.png`, `fullbucket.png`, `oilcan.png` to your inventory images folder
3. **Resource** — Place `rsg-railroad` in your resources folder
4. **Server Config** — Add to `server.cfg`:
   ```
   ensure rsg-railroad
   ```
   (After rsg-core, ox_lib, ox_target, oxmysql)
5. **Restart** your server

**Database:** No manual step needed. The resource automatically creates/verifies all of its MySQL tables (from `install/rsg_railroad_full.sql`) the first time it starts, and every restart after that — it's safe to run repeatedly since it only creates tables that don't already exist. Watch your server console on first boot for:

```
[rsg-railroad] Database tables verified/created successfully (7 statements).
```

If you'd rather import the SQL file yourself (e.g. you don't want the resource's MySQL user to need `CREATE TABLE` rights), set `Config.AutoInstallDatabase = false` in `shared/config.lua` and run `install/rsg_railroad_full.sql` manually as before.

## Languages

This resource uses ox_lib's locale system. Translations are provided for:

| Code | Language |
|------|----------|
| en | English (default) |
| de | German |
| el | Greek |
| es | Spanish |
| fr | French |
| ja | Japanese |
| nl | Dutch |
| pl | Polish |
| pt-br | Portuguese (Brazil) |
| ro | Romanian |

To change the language, set the `ox:locale` convar in your `server.cfg` (read by both ox_lib and this resource's NUI) before this resource starts, e.g.:

```
setr ox:locale de
```

If the selected language's file is missing, or a key hasn't been translated, the resource automatically falls back to `locales/en.json`. To add or edit a language, copy `locales/en.json`, translate the values (never the keys), and save it as `locales/<code>.json`.
